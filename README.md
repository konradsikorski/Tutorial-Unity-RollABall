# Tutorial-Unity-RollABall
This is my learning tour throught the Unity. I have implemented following scenes:

## Scene1: Ball on flat table
This is from standard Unity tutorial. I have extended it by adding:
- 3th person camera
- stoping the ball using spacebar
- counting all collectable objects on a map
